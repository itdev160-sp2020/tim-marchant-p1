## Project 1
- Create a website that utilizes the elements specified in Requirement 1. You may use any additional elements and techniques that you wish.

- [Requirement 1](#Requirement1)
- [Requirement 2](#Requirement2)
- [Requirement 3](#Requirement3)

## Requirement1
Utilize the following:

# HTML 
- Use a variety of the following elements: html, head, title, body, h1, ul (or ol or dl), a, img, table, p. 
Link to an external font.

# CSS
- *All styles should be defined in an external CSS file.
- Use a variety of selectors targeting elements, classes, and ids.
- Use the font that you imported into your html file. You can apply it to all text by setting the font-family property for the body element.

# JavaScript
- Inject dynamic content into your website. Dynamic content typically comes from a database or by responding to user interaction. At this point, we’re just trying to understand the basics of JavaScript and how to control aspects of a web page. As such, we’ll hardcode some data in our JavaScript file and inject it into our web page, as we did in Activity 4.
- Use variables to store data.
- Use the DOM to reference elements in your web page and inject content.

## Requirement2
Plan your project. This activity should produce the following outcomes:
- Project description
- Feature list
- List of tasks for each feature
- Create a requirements document containing these items

* We haven’t focused on requirements or documentation, so I am not looking for anything formal. I just want you to think about your project before you start coding.

## Requirement3
Manage your work using GitHub workflows, including:
- Create a new repo for your project, named firstname-lastname-p1
- Clone your project repo to your computer
- Utilize git clone [repo url] command
- Stage, Commit, and Push your project when complete.
- Utilize git add, git commit, and git push commands
